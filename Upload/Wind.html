        <h2 id="what-is">What is Wind Energy</h2>
        <p>Wind energy is a form of renewable energy that harnesses the kinetic energy of the wind to generate electricity. It is one of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy worldwide. Wind turbines, typically consisting of large blades mounted on a tower, capture the energy from the wind as it blows and convert it into rotational motion. This rotational motion drives a generator, which then produces electricity.</p>

        <h2 id="how-it-works">How Wind Turbines Work</h2>
        <p>Wind turbines work by converting the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical energy, which is then transformed into electricity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Wind Capture:</span> Wind turbines are equipped with aerodynamic blades designed to capture the kinetic energy of the wind. When the wind blows, it causes the blades to rotate.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Rotor Rotation:</span> As the blades rotate, they turn the rotor. The rotor is connected to a shaft, which transfers the rotational energy to the generator.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Generator Operation:</span> Wind turns the rotor inside the generator, creating an electric current through electromagnetic induction.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Power Conversion:</span> The electricity generated is converted to the appropriate form for transmission energy lines.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Integration with the Grid:</span> Generated electricity is seamlessly fed into the grid for widespread distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Renewable Resource:</span> Wind is a virtually unlimited resource, making wind energy sustainable in the long term.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Greenhouse Gas Reduction:</span> Wind energy produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, helping to combat climate change and reduce air pollution.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Energy Independence:</span> Harnessing wind energy reduces dependence on fossil fuels, promoting energy security and independence.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Low Operating Costs:</span> Once installed, wind turbines have relatively low operating costs compared to fossil fuel-based energy plants.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Diverse Applications:</span> Wind energy can be used for various purposes, including electricity generation, water pumping, and even powering vehicles.</li>
