                    <section>
                        <h2 id="splash">Splash Page</h2>
                            <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                                <p>This HTML file creates a splash screen that displays a branded introduction for 7 seconds before automatically redirecting the user to `home.html` using a meta refresh tag.
                                he body of the page is styled with a full-screen background image that is centered and covers the entire viewport.
                                Flexbox is used to center the content both vertically and horizontally.
                                The main content is wrapped in a `.container` div with a semi-transparent white background, rounded corners, and responsive padding, designed to remain visually appealing on different screen sizes.
                                Within the container, the company logo is displayed at the top, followed by the project name "EnerFlow" styled in a bold, underlined Orbitron font.
                                tagline and a list of group members are presented underneath, followed by an animated spinning loader, implemented using CSS keyframes (`@keyframes spin`).
                                Additionally, a fade-out animation is applied to the entire body to smoothly transition the screen's visibility before the redirect.
                                The page also includes a small footer that credits the creator with a hyperlink.</p> 
                                
                            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                                <p>The accessibility of this splash screen could be improved to better support users with disabilities and ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
                                Currently, the code lacks semantic elements that help screen readers interpret the structure of the page.
                                The animated loader does not have an accessible label or alternative description, which may confuse visually impaired users.
                                Additionally, there is no skip option or manual navigation link in case the automatic redirect fails or is disabled, which can hinder keyboard-only or screen reader users.
                                The logo image includes an `alt` attribute, which is good practice, but overall, the splash screen would benefit from enhancements such as proper heading tags,contrast checks for readability and inclusion of ARIA attributes like `role="status"` for the loader.
                                Implementing these improvements would make the splash screen more inclusive and compliant with accessibility standards.</p>

                        <h2 id="volunteer">Volunteer Page</h2>
                            <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                                <p>This HTML page is a structured volunteer recruitment and review interface for EnerFlow, designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
                                It includes a header with a logo and navigation bar linking to different site sections.
                                The main content area features volunteer opportunities, each with an image, title, description, and an application button, arranged in a visually appealing layout.
                                The page also integrates a review summary section displaying an average rating and verified review count, followed by two stylized review boxes for user feedback.
                                A feedback form allows users to submit ratings and written reviews, with emoji-based sentiment input and action buttons for submission and reset.
                                External resources like Google Fonts and Font Awesome are used for custom typography and icons, and multiple CSS files (`style.css` and `volunteer.css`) are linked for styling.
                                The footer includes contact links, social media icons, and a page editor credit.The use of semantic HTML elements helps with accessibility and SEO, while Flexbox layout and consistent class naming contribute to maintainability and responsive design.</p> 

                            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                                <p>The accessibility of this EnerFlow volunteer page is fairly strong but could be enhanced for a more inclusive user experience.
                                It uses semantic HTML elements which improve structure for screen readers and assistive technologies.
                                Alt attributes are correctly used for images, helping visually impaired users understand visual content.
                                The feedback form includes clear labels and placeholder text, and emoji-based ratings are visually intuitive, though they lack ARIA labels or `role` attributes for screen reader compatibility.
                                Navigation is straightforward, but keyboard focus indicators and skip links are not present, which may hinder users relying on keyboard navigation.
                                Additionally, color contrast and focus states should be tested to ensure compliance with WCAG standards.
                                Incorporating ARIA roles, proper heading levels, and live region announcements (especially for interactive elements like form submission) would further improve accessibility and user experience for all users.</p>

                            <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                                <p>This HTML document presents an educational and interactive webpage about hydropower as part of the EnerFlow project.
                                The structure follows modern web development practices, using semantic tags for clear content organization and accessibility.
                                It incorporates external resources such as Google Fonts for typography and Font Awesome for social media icons.
                                The navigation bar offers links to related pages and in-page anchor links to specific sections like "About", "How it Works", "Types", "Benefits", and "Challenges".
                                Each section is marked with headings and enriched with paragraphs, images, and nested lists to explain complex information clearly.
                                The layout uses CSS classes for consistent formatting and responsive design.
                                Images are used with descriptive `alt` attributes to support visual understanding and accessibility.
                                Additionally, a "Go to Top" anchor improves navigation on long pages.
                                The footer includes legal links, social media icons and an editor credit, making the page complete and user-friendly.
                                Overall, the page is well-structured, content-rich and designed for clarity, engagement and maintainability.</p> 

                            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                                <p>The hydropower webpage demonstrates good foundational accessibility practices but still has room for improvement to meet higher accessibility standards.
                                It uses semantic HTML elements which help screen readers and assistive technologies understand the page structure.
                                Images include `alt` attributes aiding visually impaired users in grasping visual content.
                                The in-page navigation uses anchor links for quick access to different sections enhancing usability for all users.
                                However, there are areas to enhance such as adding ARIA landmarks or roles for better screen reader support, ensuring sufficient color contrast for readability, and including keyboard focus indicators for interactive elements.
                                Additionally, headings should follow a logical hierarchy to maintain content flow for assistive technologies.
                                Adding skip links and ensuring all links have clear, descriptive text would further improve navigation and accessibility.
                                By addressing these areas the page can become more inclusive and compliant with WCAG guidelines.</p>

                        <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                            <p>Developing the above EnerFlow web pages presented several challenges and valuable lessons that highlight the complexities of building structured, accessible, and user-friendly content.
                            One key challenge was ensuring consistent design and layout across different pages, which required careful use of external CSS files and flexible layout techniques like Flexbox and semantic HTML.
                            Managing multiple image paths and ensuring they loaded correctly across folder structures also demanded attention to detail.
                            ccessibility posed another challenge, particularly in making sure that screen readers, keyboard navigation, and visual contrast were adequately supported—highlighting the importance of using semantic tags, alt attributes, and proper heading hierarchies.
                            Integrating user interaction elements like feedback forms and review sections introduced lessons in form usability, validation practices, and maintaining visual harmony.
                            Additionally, maintaining responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility reinforced the value of using mobile-first design principles and testing across devices.
                            Overall, these experiences emphasized the importance of planning content structure, writing clean, reusable code, and prioritizing accessibility and performance from the start.</p>
