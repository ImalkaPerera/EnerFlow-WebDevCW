            <section>
                <h2 id="home">Home Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>The Home Page introduces the EnerFlow initiative with an engaging design. It uses semantic HTML tags
                    like header, main, and footer for good organization. <br>
                    A full-screen background video plays automatically in the main hero section. A dark overlay was
                    added on top so the text is easy to read. <br>
                    The page uses a CSS grid to create responsive card layouts for the "Explore Topics" and "Our
                    Services" sections. These cards have a hover effect for interactivity. There is also a
                    Call-to-Action (CTA) section with a button to encourage user engagement.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Accessibility was a priority. All images have descriptive alt text for screen readers. Semantic HTML
                    provides a logical structure for assistive technologies. Good color contrast was used to make text
                    readable, like the overlay on the video. The navigation bar highlights the current page to help with
                    navigation.</p>

                <h3>Link to the validation page</h3>
                <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the splash page -->
                <p><a href="validation_ST0.html#splashVal">Include a link to the validation page</a>, use the marker to
                    jump to the corresponding section of the validation page.</p>

                <h3>Link to the page</h3>
                <p><a href="../home.html">click to go to home</a></p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="table">Table Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>The Table page shows global clean energy data in a structured way. The main feature is a table with a
                    complex header that uses merged cells to group columns. <br>
                    Styling for this Table page is handled by a css. The table is
                    interactive, with hover effects that make the rows change color and grow slightly in size. It also
                    uses alternating row colors, known as zebra-striping, to make the data easier to read.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>This page was designed with accessibility in mind. It has a table caption that is hidden visually but
                    can be read by screen readers for context. <br>
                    The table header cells use a "scope" attribute, which helps screen readers understand the
                    relationship between headers and data cells. All images, like the logo in the table, have
                    descriptive alt text. The clear structure and color choices also help make the data easy for
                    everyone to read and understand.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>This content page provides detailed information about Solar Energy. A key feature is the internal
                    navigation menu, which allows users to jump to different sections within the same page. <br>
                    The page also includes a "Go to Top" button that stays fixed in the corner of the screen as the user
                    scrolls. The page is styled using internal CSS, which includes a smooth-scrolling effect for a
                    better user experience when navigating between sections.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The page is built with a clear heading structure, making it easy to navigate with assistive
                    technologies. All images on the page include descriptive alt text, which is essential for screen
                    readers. The links in the internal navigation menu are clearly labeled to ensure users know where
                    each link will take them on the page.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>A key challenge was ensuring all pages had a consistent look and feel. This required careful
                    coordination to use the shared CSS file and website template correctly. A major lesson was that
                    clear communication and agreeing on a design early on are critical for teamwork. <br>
                    Implementing the responsive layouts, especially for the complex table and the card grids, was also a
                    challenge. This taught us the importance of using browser developer tools to test and fix CSS issues
                    on different screen sizes. <br>
                    Finally, managing all the internal links for the navigation bar and the content page jumpers
                    required careful planning to get the file paths and anchor links right. This reinforced the lesson
                    of keeping a well-organized file structure from the beginning of the project.</p>

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>The web pages I created were developed to be compliant with the Janet regulations governing web page publication. <br>
                    The content on these pages is strictly for educational purposes as part of a university coursework project. The material is non-commercial, and care was taken to ensure it is appropriate for a public website. <br>
                    To comply with intellectual property rules, all external resources and data sources have been credited in the "References" section of the pages where they were used. The website also follows accessibility guidelines to ensure the content is available to all users. In creating these pages, I have made a truthful effort to adhere to these standards</p>
