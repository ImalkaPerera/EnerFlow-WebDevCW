                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The feedback form uses semantic HTML5 ("form", "fieldset", "input" types) for structure and CSS Flexbox for responsive layout. Key features include a star rating system with hover effects, character counter for textareas, and accessible form controls with proper labeling. The design employs a blue/gold color scheme with subtle shadows and rounded corners for visual appeal.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The page includes ARIA attributes, proper form labels, required field indicators, and title attributes for validation messages. The star rating system uses large click targets and visual feedback.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3>

                <h2 id="team">Team Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The team page features an interactive card layout built with HTML5 and CSS Flexbox. Each team member card includes hover effects with smooth transitions, image scaling, and a sliding details panel. The responsive design uses flex-wrap and gap properties to maintain proper spacing across devices, while subtle shadows and rounded corners enhance visual appeal.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The page implements alt text for all member images, semantic HTML structure for better screen reader navigation, and maintains sufficient color contrast for readability. Hover interactions have visual indicators while remaining keyboard-navigable.</p>

                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the splash page -->
                        <p><a href="validation_ST3.html#teamVal">link to the validation page</a>, use the marker to jump to the corresponding section of the validation page.</p> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the validation page and make it jump to the marker that contains a snapshot for the splash page -->

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The wind energy page features a full-screen video background with a semi-transparent content overlay for readability. Content is organized using semantic HTML5 and CSS Flexbox for responsive layout. Key features include interactive hover effects, a components diagram with flex layout, and clear visual hierarchy through typography and color contrast.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The page includes video alternatives for unsupported browsers, semantic heading structure, sufficient color contrast, and proper alt text for images. The muted autoplay video prevents accessibility issues while maintaining visual appeal.</p>

                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the splash page -->

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During the development process, one of the biggest challenges was keeping the site layout consistent across all devices. Managing responsive design without breaking the structure taught me the importance of planning with mobile in mind first. I also faced some issues with CSS specificity, which helped me understand how cascading rules actually behave in practice. Looking back, each obstacle forced me to troubleshoot, experiment, and strengthen my debugging skills. I learned that version control is not just for teams — it saved me a few times during solo work too.

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>To ensure the site follows web regulations (like those from JANET), I focused on semantic HTML, accessible navigation, and valid CSS. Every image includes descriptive alt text, font contrast ratios are readable, and links are clear and meaningful. I tested the pages using accessibility tools and made sure the layout works across major browsers. This project helped me realize that accessibility isn't just a requirement — it’s part of good design.</p>
